                        <p>He lived a life of solitude and disappointment without a father, left by his father with his addicted mother at a young age. Several experiences thereafter convinced him that there is no way to eliminate evil except through evil itself. He believed that there is no way for human nature to remain pure without punishment. The story explores how one's true nature is revealed when faced with death. Jhone decides to purify the world by eliminating those who immerse themselves in it, engaging in an intellectual war against misguided concepts and laws that lack a basis of truth. All of this and more can be found in the novel</p>
